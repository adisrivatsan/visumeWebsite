The focus is on accent, body language recognition etc and so the content is secondary. So we don't expect fully professional, rehearsed videos. Expect this to take 15 mins for the three sessions in total ( with the re-takes included).

How to record

1) Any video recording device - mobile device / tablet/ webcam/ video cam etc- is ok
2) Please make sure you have sufficient lighting and no / minimal background noise
3) Please make sure we can see the top part of your body and your hands - as we are trying to understand body language as well
